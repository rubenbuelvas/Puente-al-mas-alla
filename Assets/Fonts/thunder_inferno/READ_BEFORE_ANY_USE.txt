Thunder Inferno is a gothic black metal typeface with sharp serifs. 

Rooted in the aesthetics of heavy metal and the occult, this typeface is a harbinger of darkness and intensity. 
Evocative of Halloween and gothic grandeur, Thunder Inferno also captures a march toward darkness. It serves as a rebellious voice for skate culture and alternative lifestyles.
Crafted exclusively in uppercase, this font is a growl in typographic form, a visual cacophony that grabs your attention and refuses to let go. 

Capitalize the first and last letters of any word for symmetrical heavy metal style.
Example: Heavy metaL 

Enclose any word in < > ( ) [ ] { } to give it wings.
Example: [HawkstylE]
